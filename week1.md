## Devlog2 - Collaboration With Computers

_AARON Article_

A theoretical tool that could be interesting in my work is a generator for visual scores for sound art pieces. The tool could take different frequencies/vibrations and tones and draw lines or shapes with colors based on those frequencies/vibrations. I guess it would have to have functions that determine what shape goes with what frequency and what size the shape is. The tool would initially need a sound art piece that I create on my own to then use to create the visual score.  The tool could be called something like Soundscore, or maybe something more AI’ey like SLAIT (sound landscape artificial intelligence tool). Programs like this are so interesting when considering how they collaborate with humans and I’m super interested in what kind of coding goes into something like this.

_NoPaint_
  
Nopaint is interesting because the program makes you feel like you are the artist, but in reality, the rules and functions are already set to a specific number of “stickers”, or whatever you wanna call them, and their path of movement is random. You can determine where to stop them in their path, but you are still at the mercy of the random path already chosen for that sticker. I think in this program, the user is definitely secondary in creating the art. The randomness is really what outlines the artwork. I think in life outside of my computer, randomness is everywhere, like in people who I see when I’m at the grocery store, or if a deer runs in front of my car, or any number of other random things. I think in a way, NoPaint is a lot like life in that something unexpected can come out of nowhere, but once you get into a situation, you can semi-control it from there.
